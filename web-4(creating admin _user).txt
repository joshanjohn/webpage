  CREATING AN ADMIN USER 
 ========================

1. First we’ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. 
      
		type:
		    >python manage.py createsuperuser
2. Enter your desired username and press enter.

		
		    Username: admin

3. You will then be prompted for your desired email address

		
		     Email address: admin@example.com

4. Enter your password.
		     
		      
		     Password: **********
		     Password (again): *********
		     Superuser created successfully.

  START THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
 ===============================

The Django admin site is activated by default. Let’s start the development server and explore it.

If the server is not running start it like so:

		type:
		     >python manage.py runserver

	# open a Web browser and go to “/admin/” on your local domain 
	    e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.

  MAKETHE POLL APP MODIFIABLE IN TEH ADMIN
============================================
But where’s our poll app? It’s not displayed on the admin index page.

Only one more thing to do: we need to tell the admin that Question objects have an admin interface. 
To do this, open the polls/admin.py file, and edit it to look like this:

from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Question

admin.site.register(Question)
