Creating a project
-------------------
1. Create a mysite directory in your current directory.

	type:
	    >django-admin startproject mysite

2.Run the sever locally.
	type:
	    >python manage.py runserver
			or
	    >python manage.py runserver 8080

3.Creating the Polls app

	To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py
	type:
	    >python manage.py startapp polls

4. Open the file polls/views.py and put the following Python code in it:

from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")

		


5. In the polls/urls.py file include the following code:

from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]



6.The next step is to point the root URLconf at the polls.urls module.
INCLUDE FOLLOWING CODES IN mysite/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]



7. Run the sever locally.
	type:
	    >python manage.py runserver
